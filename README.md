# Crio Launch 2020

**Crio Launch** is one of the awesome things happened with me, this year. 
 Very happy to share that I have successfully graduated from Crio.Do Launch 2020. 

This program not only helped me in learning new skills but also it has boosted my confidence a lot. 
It has taught me to have patience whenever you are stuck at something. There was a place for everything:
- [x] Filezilla
- [x] Wireshark
- [x] Postman
- [x] Gradle & whatnot.

The philosophy of **#_LearningByDoing_** resonated very well. It was indeed an **#_WorkLike_** experience 
right from getting the notes from the **Product Manager** for the required features to the instructions from 
the **Tech-Lead** for the execution of each module to going through the forum to get the issues solved.

The past **10 weeks** were stretching and sometimes straining too, but the learning that it offered, it was 
worth all the efforts. I learnt a great deal about increasing efficiency, writing clean code, and working 
as a team.

Here is my [Crio Portfolio](/https://bit.ly/3aLEhUQ) : all the work I have done is stored in 
private repositories.

This would not have been possible without the mentorship and support of Ajay Ravindra, Rathinamurthy R, 
and the entire team of Crio.Do. Thank you very much for such a great experience! I would also like to 
thank my friend Atishay Jain for motivating me throughout the Crio journey.
